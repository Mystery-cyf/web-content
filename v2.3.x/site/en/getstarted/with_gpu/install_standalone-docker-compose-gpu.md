# Install Milvus Cluster with Docker Compose

This topic describes how to install a Milvus cluster with GPU support using Docker Compose.

## Prerequisites

Before installing Milvus with GPU support, make sure you have the following prerequisites:

- The compute capability of your GPU device is 7.0、7.5、8.0、8.6、8.9、9.0. To check whether your GPU device suffices the requirement, check [Your GPU Compute Capability](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-gpus) on the NVIDIA developer website.

- You have installed the NVIDIA driver for your GPU device on one of [the supported Linux distributions](https://docs.nvidia.com/datacenter/cloud-native/container-toolkit/latest/install-guide.html#linux-distributions) and then the NVIDIA Container Toolkit following [this guide](https://docs.nvidia.com/datacenter/cloud-native/container-toolkit/latest/install-guide.html).

  For Ubuntu 22.04 users, you can install the driver and the container toolkit with the following commands:

  ```shell
  $ sudo apt install --no-install-recommends nvidia-headless-545 nvidia-utils-545
  ```

  For other OS users, please refer to the [official installation guide](https://docs.nvidia.com/datacenter/cloud-native/container-toolkit/install-guide.html#installing-on-ubuntu-and-debian).

  You can check whether the driver has been installed correctly by running the following command:

  ```shell
  $ modinfo nvidia | grep "^version"
  version:        535.161.07
  ```

  You are recommended to use the drivers of version 535 and above.

- You have installed a Kubernetes cluster, and the `kubectl` command-line tool has been configured to communicate with your cluster. It is recommended to run this tutorial on a cluster with at least two nodes that are not acting as control plane hosts.

- You have installed Docker and Docker Compose on your local machine.
- Check [the requirements](prerequisite-docker.md) for hardware and software requirements before installing Milvus.

  - For the users using MacOS 10.14 or later, set the Docker virtual machine (VM) to use a minimum of 2 virtual CPUs (vCPUs) and 8 GB of initial memory. Otherwise, the installation might fail.

## Install Milvus Standalone with Docker Compose

To install Milvus standalone with Docker Compose, follow these steps:

### Download and configure the `YAML` file

[Download](https://github.com/milvus-io/milvus/releases/download/v2.3.21/milvus-standalone-docker-compose-gpu.yml) `milvus-standalone-docker-compose-gpu.yml` and save it as `docker-compose.yml` manually, or with the following command.

  ```
  $ wget https://github.com/milvus-io/milvus/releases/download/v2.3.21/milvus-standalone-docker-compose-gpu.yml -O docker-compose.yml
  ```

  You need to make some changes to the environment variables of the standalone service in the YAML file as follows:

  - To assign a specific GPU device to Milvus, locate the `deploy.resources.reservations.devices[0].devices_ids` field in the definition of the `standalone` service and replace its value with the ID of the desired GPU. You can use the `nvidia-smi` tool, included with NVIDIA GPU display drivers, to determine the ID of a GPU device. Milvus supports multiple GPU devices.

  Assign a single GPU device to Milvus:

  ```yaml
  ...
  standalone:
    ...
    deploy:
      resources:
        reservations:
          devices:
            - driver: nvidia
              capabilities: ["gpu"]
              device_ids: ["0"]
  ...
  ```

  Assign multiple GPU devices to Milvus:

  ```yaml
  ...
  standalone:
    ...
    deploy:
      resources:
        reservations:
          devices:
            - driver: nvidia
              capabilities: ["gpu"]
              device_ids: ['0', '1']
  ...
  ```

### Start Milvus

In the directory that holds `docker-compose.yml`, start Milvus by running:

```shell
$ sudo docker compose up -d
```

<div class="alert note">

If you failed to run the above command, please check whether your system has Docker Compose V1 installed. If this is the case, you are advised to migrate to Docker Compose V2 due to the notes on [this page](https://docs.docker.com/compose/).

</div>

```text
Creating milvus-etcd  ... done
Creating milvus-minio ... done
Creating milvus-standalone ... done
```

Now check if the containers are up and running.

```
$ sudo docker compose ps
```

## Verify the Installation

After Milvus standalone starts, there will be three docker containers running, including the Milvus standalone service and its two dependencies.

```
      Name                     Command                  State                            Ports
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
milvus-etcd         etcd -advertise-client-url ...   Up             2379/tcp, 2380/tcp
milvus-minio        /usr/bin/docker-entrypoint ...   Up (healthy)   9000/tcp
milvus-standalone   /tini -- milvus run standalone   Up             0.0.0.0:19530->19530/tcp, 0.0.0.0:9091->9091/tcp
```

If you have assigned multiple GPU devices to Milvus in `docker-compose.yml`, you can specify which GPU device is visible or available for use.

Make GPU device `0` visible to Milvus:

```shell
CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0 ./milvus run standalone
```

Make GPU devices `0` and `1` visible to Milvus:

```shell
CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0,1 ./milvus run standalone
```

### Connect to Milvus

Verify which local port the Milvus server is listening on. Replace the container name with your own.

```bash
$ docker port milvus-standalone 19530/tcp
```

Please refer to [Hello Milvus](https://milvus.io/docs/example_code.md), then run the example code.

## Configure memory pool

After Milvus is up and running, you can customize the memory pool by modifying the `initMemSize` and `maxMemSize` settings in the `milvus.yaml` file.

<div class="alert note">

The `milvus.yaml` file is located in the `/milvus/configs/` directory inside the Milvus container.

</div>

To confgiure the memory pool, modify the `initMemSize` and `maxMemSize` settings in the `milvus.yaml` file as follows.

1. Use the following command to copy `milvus.yaml` from the Milvus container to your local machine. Replace `<milvus_container_id>` with your actual Milvus container ID.

    ```shell
    docker cp <milvus_container_id>:/milvus/configs/milvus.yaml milvus.yaml
    ```

2. Open the copied `milvus.yaml` file with your preferred text editor. For example, using vim:

    ```shell
    vim milvus.yaml
    ```

3. Edit the `initMemSize` and `maxMemSize` settings as needed and save your changes:

    ```yaml
    ...
    gpu:
      initMemSize: 0
      maxMemSize: 0
    ...
    ```

    - `initMemSize`: Initial size of the memory pool. Defaults to 1024.
    - `maxMemSize`: Maximum size of the memory pool. Defaults to 2048.

4. Use the following command to copy the modified `milvus.yaml` file back to the Milvus container. Replace `<milvus_container_id>` with your actual Milvus container ID.

    ```shell
    docker cp milvus.yaml <milvus_container_id>:/milvus/configs/milvus.yaml
    ```

5. Restart the Milvus container to apply the changes:

    ```shell
    docker stop <milvus_container_id>
    docker start <milvus_container_id>
    ```

## Stop Milvus

To stop Milvus standalone, run:
```
sudo docker compose down
```

To delete data after stopping Milvus, run:
```
sudo rm -rf  volumes
```
